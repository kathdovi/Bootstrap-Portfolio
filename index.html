                <p>Hello! I am a senior linguistics major at UT Austin. I am currently in the UT Austin full stack bootcamp
                    because I found my passion for code a little too late. Along with web development, I also have skills
                    and experience working in Python and Java. I am in the process of completing the Elements of Computer
                    Programming certificate from the UTCS department along with my degree. I have also worked in Ruby and
                    Rust, and I learn quickly and am always eager for new knowledge. Challenges excite me, and I am always
                    up for a puzzle! Additionally, I have some experience with design and graphics.</p>
                <p> In my free time, I like to read, play guitar and sing, learn new languages, and encourage political engagement.
                    Currently, I am the communications director for University Democrats at UT Austin, so I run our twitter
                    (@UDems... follow us) and make memes to make students aware of deadlines to register to vote and election
                    days. I also respond to media requests and manage other social media outlets. Before college, I was in
                    a band that played at a festival among the ranks of Joan Jett and Cheap Trick. I speak English, French,
                    German, Norwegian, and some Spanish. I'm also an avid traveller and have visited 27 countries -- that's
                    6 more than my age.</p>
                <p> After graduation, I hope to get a job in full-stack or front-end web development. I am seeking employment
                    starting summer 2019. I would be best suited to work somewhere that values creativity and progressive
                    values and is not afraid to expect great things from their new employees. I'm ready to start doing good
                    work for some good people!</p>
